# Personal-Website

A personal Website created for Intro to Web Development. This Website will have pages describing my current acheivments, skills, and projects I've worked on. Also the website will have a bio page about me.
This website will display my skills developed in web development. I used W3schools as inspiration and looked at some professional portfolio websites to inform my styling.

To run the code download the Personal_website folder.
